# About the Collection
## __Goals__
Materials left behind hold a special significance to me. From a young age, I was attracted to the cast off scrap iron, the rusted old radio. I guess that's followed me into my 20s, as when I began this project I found myself staring at a wall lined with wine corks (in order of largest to smallest).

Drinking the wine is supposed to be the fun part of the whole experience. But what happens to the humble cork, the stopper in the way of that experience after it is done? Is it discarded? Kept to be later reused? In my case, I realized I could use the corks as synechdoche to talk about the wines itself, and catalog the drinking habits of my amateur sommelier-ing.

In starting this project, I had large goals. I wanted to make a 3d model of each of the corks, to be placed on Thingiverse and hosted on the website. Due to constraints on both my time and technical expertise, this eventually did not end up happening. I wanted each object in the collection (each cork) to be visible from all angles and to do a comparison of the difference between colors of the regular and stained ends of the corks.

## __Takeaways__
Although my product fell short of my goals, these are all things that can still be done with this project. In going through this experience while I was frustrated in the moment with my own limitations, I am filled with excitement at the ideas I have moving forward in filling out the collection and keeping it current with new wines.
