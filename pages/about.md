# About the Collection
## __Goals__
Materials left behind hold a special significance to me. From a young age, I was attracted to the cast off scrap iron, the rusted old radio. I guess that's followed me into my 20s, as when I began this project I found myself staring at a wall lined with wine corks (in order of largest to smallest).

Drinking the wine is supposed to be the fun part of the whole experience. But what happens to the humble cork, the stopper in the way of that experience after it is done? Is it discarded? Kept to be later reused? In my case, I realized I could use the corks as synechdoche to talk about the wines itself, and catalog the drinking habits of my amateur sommelier-ing.

In starting this project, I had large goals. I wanted to make a 3d model of each of the corks, to be placed on Thingiverse and hosted on the website. Due to constraints on both my time and technical expertise, this eventually did not end up happening. I wanted each object in the collection (each cork) to be visible from all angles and to do a comparison of the difference between colors of the regular and stained ends of the corks.

### Initial Metadata Application Profile

Looking at the collection that I ended up with, I am nevertheless satisfied. Although I was unable to implement each facet of my goals, I am filled with excitement at the ideas I have moving forward in filling out the collection and keeping it current with new wines. The collection itself contains 29 wine corks at various (affordable) price points, all including the ratings of at least one of three acclaimed wine review sites. Feel free to [explore](https://sethcope96.github.io/Put-A-Cork-In-It/browse.html) the collection visually, or search through the [map](https://sethcope96.github.io/Put-A-Cork-In-It/map.html) to find your favorite region! Although the initial upload shows that there are a lot of Californian and Italian wines in my collection, I hope to continue updating the collection in the future. I hear New Zealand makes a mean Chardonnay?
